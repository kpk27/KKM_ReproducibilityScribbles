# Introduction {#introduction}
This is an introduction to reproducibility in R

##Starting with RStudio
This is information about RStudio

### Opening RStudio
Shows different panes

you can add **bold text** or __bold text with underscores__

you can do *italics* also with _single underscore_

Add in a superscript ^is^

Or a subscript using ~tilde~

If you add inline code use the backtick `to write code`

Finally, use strikethrough text using ~~double tilde~~ 

If you are writing a lot of text
then you might want to break it up into two lines
using just one 'enter' button.

We have covered this in the [Introduction section](#introduction)

You can also create [links to for example google](https://www.google.com). 

You might have some link to a footnote [^1]. 

[^1]: this is my first footnote.

## Tables

you can create tables using | -

|column header | another column |
| -------------| ---------------|
| first row    | with info      |
| more rows    | with more info |

# doing quotes or blocks

> a greater than sign creates blocks 

How does that look? New fonts!

How would you highlight code?

Use single `backticks` inline

If you have a whole chunk of code, do this: 

```
print("hello")
read.csc("data.txt")
```
Or you could use the follow to insert a R code specifically  ctrl+alt+I or go to 'code' and click 'insert chunk'

```{r}
75*2
```
```{r}
calc_output<- 100*3
calc_output
```

```{r}
calc_output*5
```
